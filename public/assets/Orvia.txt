Orvia AI Assistant – Business Plan (No‑Code Build)
Prepared for: Muhammad Zaid (VirtuProse Solutions)
Date: 10 November 2025
1) Executive Summary
Vision: Build a chat‑first operating system that connects to a business’s live database to book appointments, take payments, and sell products across web and WhatsApp—without code.
Positioning: Not a 'chatbot'. A revenue and operations assistant that reduces response time, automates bookings, and converts more customers 24/7.
Initial Target Niches: Clinics/Salons, Real Estate, E‑commerce SMBs Globally.
Model: SaaS tiers + one‑time onboarding + white‑label for agencies.
2) Branding & Naming
Brand principles: short, global, trustworthy, tech‑forward, Arabic/English friendly.
Name: Orvia
Tagline: Orvia books, charges, and closes.
3) Problem → Solution
Problem: Businesses juggle forms, calls, and DMs. Slow replies kill conversions.
Solution: A single conversational interface that reads inventory/slots in real time, books, invoices, and updates CRM automatically.
4) Product – Core Features (V1)
Live database connection (Airtable / Supabase / Google Sheets).
Appointments: check availability, book, reschedule, cancel, reminders.
Payments: Stripe / Razorpay / Tap Payments checkout links inside chat.
Catalog search: filter by price/size/feature, send links/images.
Lead qualification: capture name/email/budget; route to sales via WhatsApp/Email.
Human handoff: agent can take over the chat; transcript saved.
Multi‑channel: Website/App widget + WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API/360dialog/Twilio).
‑language:, Auto‑detect.
Analytics: sessions, leads, bookings, revenue, top queries, time saved.
Admin: simple panel for content, FAQs, prices, hours, teams.
5) Durable Differentiators
Transactional first: bookings + payments + CRM—not just FAQs.
Localization: All supported currencies
White‑label for agencies with custom branding/domain.
APIs-first architecture so it plugs into POS/ERP/CRM later.
6) No‑Code Architecture & Stack
Chat UI: Botpress Cloud or Flowise‑UI (embed on website).
LLM: OpenAI GPT‑4o (Assistants API) or Claude via API.
Workflow Orchestration: n8n (Docker) for intents → actions → DB → payments.
Database: Airtable (fast start) → Supabase (scale).
Payments: Stripe (global), Razorpay (India), Tap Payments (GCC).
WhatsApp: Meta Cloud API or 360dialog; optional Twilio.
Auth: magic link/OTP for returning customers; JWT for admins.
Hosting: n8n on a VPS (Hetzner/Linode) or Render; DB on Supabase; files on S3.
Analytics: PostHog or Plausible + Looker Studio dashboards.
7) Minimal Data Model
Users(id, name, phone, email, locale, last_seen)
Products(id, name, price, currency, attributes, stock, image_url)
Appointments(id, user_id, service_id, staff_id, datetime, status)
Services(id, name, duration, price)
Transactions(id, user_id, amount, currency, payment_provider, status, meta)
Conversations(id, user_id, channel, transcript_url, lead_score)
8) Key Flows
Appointment Booking: intent → availability query → confirmation → calendar invite → reminder → optional payment link.
Purchase: query → product filter → cart build → checkout link → order record → receipt.
Lead Qualification: greet → capture details → route to CRM → notify sales on WhatsApp.
Human Handoff: confidence low → escalate to agent → transcript sync.
9) Security & Compliance
Data minimization; encrypt secrets; rotate API keys.
Role‑based admin panel; audit logs for actions.
Regional data residency where possible (Supabase region).
PCI compliance handled by Stripe/Razorpay/Tap; never store card data.
10) Pricing
Starter $49: 1 channel, 1k messages, basic analytics.
Pro $149: multi‑channel, payments/appointments, 10k messages.
Business $299: CRM integrations, advanced analytics, SLA.
White‑label $699 + $99/bot/month for agencies.
11) Go‑to‑Market (90 Days)
Week 1–2: pick one niche (Clinics). Build 2 demo bots. Landing page + 2‑min demo video.
Week 3–4: outbound to 200 prospects (Kuwait, UAE, India). Offer pilot at KD 99 setup.
Week 5–6: onboard 5 pilots; measure leads/bookings; testimonials.
Week 7–8: launch paid ads (Meta + Google) with case study proof.

12) Messaging & Positioning
One‑liner: 'The AI assistant that books, charges, and closes—on web and WhatsApp.'
Clinic headline: 'Patients don’t wait. Appointments book themselves.'
E‑com headline: 'Customers ask. The bot sells.'
13) Sales Scripts (Short)
Cold DM/Email:
Subject: Your bookings are leaking. Fix in 48 hours.
Hi [Name], I noticed [Business] takes bookings via phone/forms. We install an AI assistant that checks availability, books, and collects payments inside WhatsApp and your site. Avg response time drops to under 10s; bookings go up 15–30%. Want a 15‑min demo? – Zaid
WhatsApp Opener:
“Quick idea: add an AI assistant to your WhatsApp that books appointments from DMs automatically. Can show you a working demo for clinics like yours—free setup if you’re in the first 10.”
14) Execution Plan (Build)
Spin up VPS + Docker; deploy n8n; connect OpenAI key.
Create Airtable base (Products, Services, Appointments).
Build intents in Botpress (Book, Buy, Pay, Handoff).
Wire actions in n8n: DB read/write, Stripe link, Google Calendar invite.
Embed chat widget on demo site; connect Meta WhatsApp sandbox.
Add analytics events; test Arabic flows; run 10 scripted test cases.
15) Risks & Mitigations
LLM hallucination → retrieval + tool‑only answers for high‑risk steps.
API limits/downtime → queue/retry logic in n8n; status page.
WhatsApp approval delays → start with website widget; parallel WA application.
Niche mismatch → rapid pilot feedback; pivot niche within 30 days.

Hosting (VPS + Supabase): $30–$60/mo
OpenAI usage (pilots): $30–$150/mo
Botpress/Flowise: $0–$50/mo
